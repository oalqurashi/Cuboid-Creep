## Problem Definition

Developing an interactive 2.5D game which consists of:
- 2D and 3D Polygons and other shapes
- Animations for all characters and maps
- Enemies that chase the player
- Pathfinding for enemies in the game (Shortest-Path Algorithm)

These points should be implemented using the _Java OpenGL Library_. This game will help users to develop his/her decision-making skills.

## The Idea

The project is about an interactive game called Cuboid Creep:
- Itâ€™s based on the 1980 Pacman game.
- The objective of this game is to reach the final stage and defeat the boss.
- There are multiple stages to complete. The stages are squares that are connected as a 3D cube object.
- When the player reaches the end of any stage, he/she will go to the next stage.
- Each stage has obstacles, such as enemies and  traps to avoid, torches that alert enemies and reduced field of vision.

## Missing Items

Due to the shortness of that semester, and the coronavirus pandemic our time to develop this game was cut short, so this is the list of things that we would have liked to include 
in our game:
- The 6 stages were reduced to 3 stages.
- Traps that the player would need to avoid.
- Interactable objects in the game.
- Reduced vision for the player.
- Images of the enemies were scrapped because of compatibility issues.
- A better UI design.
- Start screen
