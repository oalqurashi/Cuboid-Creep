# Cuboid-Creep
The Idea:

The project will be about an interactive game called Cuboid Creep; it’s based on the 1980 Pacman game.  The objective of this game is to reach the final stage and defeat the boss. There are multiple stages to  complete. The stages are squares that will be connected as a 3D cube object. When the player reaches  the end of any stage, he/she will go to the next stage. Each stage has obstacles, such as enemies and  traps to avoid, torches that alert enemies and reduced field of vision.

Missing Items:

Due to the shortness of the semester, and the coronavirus pandemic our time to 
develop this game was cut short, so this is the list of things that we would have liked to include 
in our game:
• The 6 stages were reduced to 3 stages.
• Traps that the player would need to avoid.
• Interactable objects in the game.
• Reduced vision for the player.
• Images of the enemies were scrapped because of compatibility issues.
• A better UI design.
• Start screen
